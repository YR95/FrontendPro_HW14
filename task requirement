hero = ['Ivan'];
native = ['York','Of'];
destination = ['Poltava','In'];
Using loops, if/else, switch/case and .push(), .pop(), .unshift(), .shift(), .concat(), .splice(), .reverse() .join() methods:

1. To concat arrays destination, native, hero into one common array - rainbow.

2. Reversed the elements in rainbow array.

3. Change/add the elements of rainbow array,
so in the end you will get array like this ['Richard','Of','York','Gave','Battle','In','Vain'];

4. Render in html the array, that you will get from the last step as in image that was added: rainbow.png.



Font-family that I used on image: Quicksand. But you can take any))

You don't have to use all methods! Use just that methods, which can help to you to create array as in the image rainbow.png.
